## Installation

### install via pip

To use PyABSA, install the latest version from pip or source code:

```bash
pip install -U pyabsa
```

### install via source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA --depth=1
cd PyABSA 
python setup.py install
```

## Examples

1. Train a model of aspect term extraction

```python3
import random

from pyabsa import AspectTermExtraction as ATEPC

config = ATEPC.ATEPCConfigManager.get_atepc_config_english()
config.model = ATEPC.ATEPCModelList.FAST_LCF_ATEPC
config.evaluate_begin = 0
config.max_seq_len = 512
config.pretrained_bert = 'yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa'
config.l2reg = 1e-8
config.seed = random.randint(1, 100)
config.use_bert_spc = True
config.use_amp = False
config.cache_dataset = False

chinese_sets = ATEPC.ATEPCDatasetList.Multilingual

aspect_extractor = ATEPC.ATEPCTrainer(config=config,
                                      dataset=chinese_sets,
                                      checkpoint_save_mode=1,
                                      auto_device=True
                                      ).load_trained_model()

atepc_examples = ['But the staff was so nice to us .',
                  'But the staff was so horrible to us .',
                  r'Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ` perks \' were great .',
                  'It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !',
                  'It was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , '
                  'the food -LRB- from appetizers to entrees -RRB- was delectable .',
                  'How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners !'
                  ]
aspect_extractor.batch_predict(inference_source=atepc_examples,  #
                               save_result=True,
                               print_result=True,  # print the result
                               pred_sentiment=True,  # Predict the sentiment of extracted aspect terms
                               )



```

2. Inference Example of aspect term extraction

```python3
from pyabsa import AspectTermExtraction as ATEPC

# checkpoint_map = available_checkpoints()


aspect_extractor = ATEPC.AspectExtractor('multilingual',
                                         auto_device=True,  # False means load model on CPU
                                         cal_perplexity=True,
                                         )

inference_source = ATEPC.ATEPCDatasetList.SemEval
atepc_result = aspect_extractor.batch_predict(inference_source=inference_source,  #
                                              save_result=True,
                                              print_result=True,  # print the result
                                              pred_sentiment=True,  # Predict the sentiment of extracted aspect terms
                                              )

print(atepc_result)


```

3. Get available checkpoints from Google Drive

PyABSA will check the latest available checkpoints before and load the latest checkpoint from Google Drive. To view
available checkpoints, you can use the following code and load the checkpoint by name:

```python3
from pyabsa import available_checkpoints

# The results of available_checkpoints() depend on the PyABSA version
checkpoint_map = available_checkpoints()  # show available checkpoints of PyABSA of current version 
```

If you can not access to Google Drive, you can download our checkpoints and load the unzipped checkpoint manually.
